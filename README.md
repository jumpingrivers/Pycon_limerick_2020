## README



This repository is for the Pycon Limerick 2020 Git workshop. 



### Description 



This workshop is an introduction to Git/GitHub. The material assumes no prior knowledge or use of Git. The aim of the material is to get participants familiar with the basics of using Git, backed by a GitHub remote repository. In particular we will explore

* Creating repositories
* Cloning and Forking
* Adding and modifying the repository
* Branching and Pull requests

The workshop will be very interactive, encouraging participants to create and modify repositories throughout and working in small groups "as a team of developers".

Since this is PyCon there is some Python code in the material, although it won't actually matter if you don't feel comfortable with Python yet. They are small examples and it is not required that you have to write your own Python code from scratch. This is a workshop about Git, not Python specific, after all.

### Before the workshop

Before the workshop, please ensure that you have Git installed on your machine and an account on GitHub. 

### Installing Git

You can check whether you have git installed already in a shell

```bash
which git
## /usr/bin/git
```

and 

```bash
git --version
## git version 2.21.0
```

If you already have it, great! No need to install.

#### Windows

Install [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/), also known as "Git Bash"

#### MacOS

**Option 1** Install Git from here: http://git-scm.com/downloads

**Option 2** `brew install git`

#### Linux

* Ubuntu or Debian `sudo apt-get install git`
* Fedora or RedHat `sudo yum install git`

### Getting an account on GitHub

Register an account with GitHub. It's free

* https://github.com

You can do things like upgrade to paid, join organizations etc in the future, so don't worry about any of that now. It might be worth thinking about the username though. 

Some tips:

* Incoporate your actual name
* Reuse your name from other contexts, e.g Twitter, Slack
* Pick a username you are comfortable sharing with boss and colleagues
* Shorter is better
* I would avoid uppercase, usernames are case sensitive
